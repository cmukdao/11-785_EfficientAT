Add biologically-inspired dendritic optimization to your PyTorch neural networks with just a few lines of code. Perforated AI (PAI) automatically enhances model accuracy in a highly parameter-efficient manner by perforating the architecture with dendrites.

<br>

**Key Innovation:** Unlike traditional neural networks that use simple point neurons, PAI adds dendritic branches that enable neurons to learn complex input patterns. Depending on your use case, PAI can deliver:
- **Up to 40% accuracy improvements** on challenging tasks
- **Up to 90% compression** without sacrificing accuracy
- **50% reduction in data requirements** for similar accuracy scores

All with **automatic network conversion** and minimal code changes.

# Documentation

See the [API Documentation](./API/README.md) for detailed integration instructions, the [Customization Guide](./API/customization.md) for advanced configuration options, and [Output Guide](./API/output.md) for understanding training visualizations.

For research on dendritic methods in deep learning, see our [Papers](./Papers) collection which includes comparisons of different approaches and our published work.

&nbsp;

# Quickstart

Add dendritic learning to your PyTorch models in minutes.

## Install the perforatedai library

```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Add dendrites to your neural network

In your training script, import PAI utilities and wrap your model initialization:

```python
from perforatedai import globals_perforatedai as GPA
from perforatedai import utils_perforatedai as UPA
import torch

# Initialize your model
model = YourModel()

# Automatically add dendritic capabilities
model = UPA.initialize_pai(model)

# Setup optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
GPA.pai_tracker.set_optimizer_instance(optimizer)

# Train your model until dendrite optimization completes
while True:
    train(model, optimizer)
    val_score = validate(model)
    
    # Report validation score and handle model restructuring
    model, restructured, training_complete = GPA.pai_tracker.add_validation_score(val_score, model)
    model = model.to(device)  # Re-send to device after potential restructuring
    
    if training_complete:
        # Training is complete - best model has been loaded
        break
    elif restructured:
        # Model was restructured with new dendrites - reinitialize optimizer
        optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)
        GPA.pai_tracker.set_optimizer_instance(optimizer)
```

PAI automatically:
- Perforates model with dendrites for selected modules
- Identifies when to add dendrites based on validation scores
- Adjusts learning rates for optimal dendritic optimization
- Generates visualization graphs showing accuracy improvements

&nbsp;

# Examples

PAI works with many popular architectures and frameworks. Check out our [Examples](./Examples) folder for complete implementations:

## Base Examples
- **[MNIST](./Examples/baseExamples/mnist)** - Classic computer vision with dendritic enhancement
- **[TD3 Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/PerforatedAI/PerforatedAI/tree/develop/Examples/reinforcementLearning/td3_cheetah)** - TD3 with dendrites for continuous control

## Advanced Examples
- **[ImageNet ResNet-18](./Examples/imagenet)** - ResNet-18 with dendritic optimization ([Pretrained Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/perforated-ai/resnet-18-perforated))
- **[Edge Impulse Block]([./Examples/hackathonProjects/example-custom-ml-block-pytorch)** - across 800 hyperparameter sweeps dendritic models consistently smarter with any given parameter count on keyword spotting in audio for edge deployment 

## Framework Integration

- **[Hugging Face](./Examples/libraryExamples/huggingface)** - Transformer models with dendritic layers

# How It Works

Traditional artificial neurons are **point neurons** - they simply sum weighted inputs and apply an activation function. Real biological neurons have **dendrites** - branching structures that perform sophisticated computations before signals reach the cell body.

**Perforated AI** adds dendritic modules to artificial neurons:

1. **Automatic Perforation**: PAI analyzes your network and perforates it with dendrites for selected modules
2. **Validation-Driven Growth**: Identifies when to add dendrites based on validation score improvements
3. **Optimized Training**: Automatically adjusts learning rates for optimal dendritic optimization
4. **Multi-Layer Support**: Unlike other dendritic methods, PAI works on multiple neuron layers simultaneously

This approach delivers:
- **Significant accuracy improvements** on challenging tasks
- **Superior parameter efficiency** compared to standard scaling
- **Reduced data requirements** for achieving target performance
- **Robustness to noise** - particularly effective in real-world conditions
- **Drop-in compatibility** - works with existing PyTorch code

See our [Papers](./Papers) directory for detailed comparisons with other dendritic learning methods.
